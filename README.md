# perception_demos
This is a work in progress collection of simple Python demonstrations of concepts from the science of perception.

Demos are viewable using Google Colaboratory, although they may make use of unsupported functions for interactivity.

The Duplex Model Demo is fully viewable and editable at this url:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/icushman/perception_demos/blob/master/duplex-model-demo.ipynb

If you make edits to this code on Colaboratory, you may need to re-run the code blocks that import dependencies and define the tone generator class before other code blocks will run.
